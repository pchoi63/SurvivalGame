## Story from Chloe
hey call me Chloe! And,  I have been stuck in a long endless storm and dangerous winter that I have to survive. My grandpa used to tell me stories about the other side of the mountain, a blessed land where the Sun comes out every single morning, and westerners call it the Summer Paradis - a destination that everyone seeks and wishes for! My grandpa - the greatest warrior ever to grace this land, lost to this deadly storm, and all the villages perished along on this cursed land. I'm all alone! I have to save my blood lineage and to this I promise my grandpa and my village, that I will fight, I will slice the throats of every single monster I find along the way with your holy Ninja star, I will survive and fight until I can't fight anymore. I'm the HOPE and the FUTURE!!
